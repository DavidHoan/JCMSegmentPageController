# JCMSegmentedPageController

Custom container view controller for iOS5 that functions similarly to a UITabBarController, but the way to switch tabs is through a UISegmentedControl on top.  [Demo](https://github.com/jcmendez/JCMSegmentPageController/blob/master/Demo/DemoSimpleTableViewController.m) included.
Very well [documented](http://jcmendez.github.com/JCMSegmentPageController/)
